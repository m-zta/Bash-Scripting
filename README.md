## create_folders.sh

Prompts the user to enter a directory path where new folders need to be created. It validates the input, ensuring that the directory exists. Then, it asks the user to provide names for the new folders, one at a time, until the user enters "-q" to exit. For each provided name, a new folder is created in the specified directory.
